To download and compile the source code on ubuntu:

make sure that you have git, g++, opengl, and sdl developmet libraries
installed:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev git-core

If you are using git:
	git clone http://csserver.exeter.edu/~hogbait/git/physics.git

otherwise, extract compressed physics folder and type:
	cd physics
	make

Hopefully, it will compile. If it doesn't, you are probably missing some
dependant libraries.

To run, type:

./Physics2D
